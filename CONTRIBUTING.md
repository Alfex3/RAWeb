# Contribution Guide

## Which Branch?

All PRs should be sent to the latest develop branch and should never be sent to the master branch.

If you discover a security vulnerability, please send an on-site message to [RAdmin](http://retroachievements.org/user/RAdmin). 

## Coding Style

Follow the [PSR-12 Coding Standard](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-12/).
